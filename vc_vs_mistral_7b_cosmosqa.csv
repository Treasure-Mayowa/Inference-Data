Context: In addition , if more than forty percent of your total fixed asset purchases occurred in the last quarter of the year , then , you must use a mid - quarter convention .

Understanding how basic depreciation works can be valuable to the small business owner because it helps to know the tax implications when planning for capital equipment purchases .What would happen if you claimed to large a deprecation expense ?A. You would get away with a big saving because small businesses do n't get audited

Context: Her chief qualifications for office appeared to be ( 1 ) Bush 's personal comfort with her , ( 2 ) her surface appeal to the religious right ( on , e.g. abortion ) , and ( 3 ) her gender . After three weeks of increasingly unpleasant discussion , Miers used a manufactured technical problem to withdraw her own nomination , and Bush appointed Samuel Alito . One of the most interesting aspects of the entire drama was the reaction of religious conservatives , the very constituency to which Miers ( herself a born - again Christian ) was intended to appeal . Several leaders among this group soon made public their concerns that Miers was a insulting sop to them .Why might have the religious conservatives objected to Miers as a supreme court justice ?A.

Context: Poll numbers released today from the Public Policy Institute of California show that California voters agree that borrowing is the wrong approach to fixing our state 's budget crisis . While an anemic 8 % of voters think it 's okay for the state to borrow money and run a budget deficit , 41 % would prefer to address our problems through a mix of spending cuts and tax increases . That 's why the Education Coalition strongly supports the original conference committee budget , which addresses our budget shortfall with a balanced package of revenues and cuts and prevents deeper cuts to schools and students .What might be true about California voters ?A. They want the state to address their problems .

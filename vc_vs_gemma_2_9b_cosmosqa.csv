Context: Her chief qualifications for office appeared to be ( 1 ) Bush 's personal comfort with her , ( 2 ) her surface appeal to the religious right ( on , e.g. abortion ) , and ( 3 ) her gender . After three weeks of increasingly unpleasant discussion , Miers used a manufactured technical problem to withdraw her own nomination , and Bush appointed Samuel Alito . One of the most interesting aspects of the entire drama was the reaction of religious conservatives , the very constituency to which Miers ( herself a born - again Christian ) was intended to appeal . Several leaders among this group soon made public their concerns that Miers was a insulting sop to them .Why might have the religious conservatives objected to Miers as a supreme court justice ?A. Because Miers only had a superficial appeal to the female Christians .
